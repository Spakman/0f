<p>Here are a couple of archived sites that I used to run:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://archive.fingers.today/2017/08/22/crocodile.is/">crocodile.is</a> - I've had a few domains, but this should be most of my personal content from 2003 - 2017</li>
		<li><a href="https://archive.fingers.today/2017/08/22/www.scottishclimbs.com/">scottishclimbs.com</a> - the online focal point of the Scottish climbing community from 2001 - 20something</li>
	</ul>

<p>These days I'm experimenting with these living documents and notes.</p>
